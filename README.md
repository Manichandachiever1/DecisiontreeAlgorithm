# **Project Title**:
Prediction of "Iris.csv" dataset for DecisionTree Algorithm using Supervised learning Machine Algorithm
# **Problem Statement:**
American based Botonical Gardens grow iris flower in their Labs but using Bio-Technology in a single tree different varieties of flowers are grown.As a DataScience Engineer find out accuracy of all categories of flowers contain same species.
